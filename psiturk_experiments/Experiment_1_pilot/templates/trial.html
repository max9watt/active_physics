    <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Note</span>: The experiment only works properly if you have your <span style="color:red">browser zoom level on 100%</span>. Please do not change the zoom level during the experiment. (You can change the zoom level to 100% by pressing "cmd+0" on a mac or "ctrl+0" on a PC.)</p>

    <p>In this experiment, your task it to make judgments about physical scenes. In each scene, you will see 4 different balls, two red balls and two yellow balls (see Figure 1).</p>
    
    <p>The balls start at random locations in the scene. In each scene, there are both global and local forces that affect how the balls move. Your task is to figure out what these forces are.</p>

   <p>In each physical scene, there are two kinds of forces: 1) A global force that affects all the balls in the same way, and 2) local forces between the balls.</p>

    <p>Figure 2 shows the four possible ways in which the global force acts on the balls in the scene. It either pulls all balls towards the left, top, right, or bottom wall. It is also possible that there is no global force affecting the balls.</p>

    <p>Figure 3 shows the different kinds of local forces that could be present in a particular world. Balls can attract or repel each other (like magnets), or they may have no influence on each other. There are local forces between balls of different color like the ones shown in Figure 3. There may also be the same kinds of local forces between balls <b>of the same color</b>. For example, red balls may attract, or repel red balls, and the same is true for the yellow balls.</p>

      <p>If the balls slow down too much, the world will start again (see Figure 2). The balls will then again be positioned at a random location in the world.</p>

    <p>If a world is restarted, the animation is paused for a short while and a black screen appears. When a world gets restarted, the global force and the local forces remain the same.</p>

    <p>When the time is over, a lasting black screen appears on top of the world.</p>

    <p>You will see 20 trials in total. Please try to answer the questions as best as you can.</p>
