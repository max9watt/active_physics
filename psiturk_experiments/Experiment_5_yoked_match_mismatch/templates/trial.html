    <p>In this experiment, your task is to make judgments about the objects in miniature physical worlds.</p>
    
    <p>In each world, you will see 4 different balls like in Figure 1. The balls start at random locations in the scene. Some pairs of balls attract each other, some repel each other, and some don't affect each other.  One of the balls may also be heavier than the others.
    </p>

    <p>Figure 2 shows the different kinds of local forces that could be present in a particular world. Balls can attract or repel each other (like magnets), or they may have no influence on each other. While all of the different pairs of balls may have different relationships, you should focus on figuring out the relationship between the two balls with letters on (here A and B).</p>

    <p>In some of the worlds, one of the labeled balls is heavier than the rest of the balls. Please try and figure out whether one of the labeled balls is heavier, or if both balls have the same mass.</p>
    
    <p>You will be given one of two tasks:
      <ol>
        <li>Figure out the relationship between the two balls with letters on (here A and B)
          <li>Figure out whether one or other of these two balls is heavier.
          </ol>
        </p>

   <p><b>You will be watching video clips of another participant interacting with the world.</b></p>

   <p>This participant was able to interact with the balls by dragging them around and releasing them with their mouse. They were able to grab the balls by clicking on them and then holding their mouse button down. They could let go of a ball by releasing the mouse button.</p>

   <p>The position of the person's mouse is indicated by a "<b>+</b>" symbol and a grabbed ball is indicated by a solid black border. In the example shown in Figure 2, they were grabbing ball B. </p>

   <p>Grabbed balls will keep their normal properties (e.g. whether they attract or repel the other balls and how heavy they are) but will be strongly attracted to the position of the grabber's mouse until the click is released.</p>

    <p>You will see <b>20</b> worlds in total. Each world will contain 4 new balls that you have not encountered before in any of the previous worlds.  Please try to answer the question as best as you can.

    <p><b>You will receive a bonus between 5 and 10 cents for each correct answer you give.</b>  Selecting the correct answer faster (before the 30 seconds are up) earns a higher bonus, but an incorrect answer earns no bonus.  You can change your mind if you like.  You will be scored based on your final answer.</p>
